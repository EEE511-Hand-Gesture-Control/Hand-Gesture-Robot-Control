# Hand-Gesture-Robot-Control

This project was our team's final project for EEE 511: Artificial Neural Computation. The purpose of this project was to create a CNN that could be used to control a UR10e robotic arm. This README outlines the steps necessary to run the project on your own platform with the following **Requirements**:

## Requirements
- System Requirements:
    - Network Connection to the Robot
    - Python Installation
    - What we used:
        - Asus Zephyrus 14 Laptop
        - Ryzen 9 5900 series processor
        - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 40GB of RAM
        - 2 Terabyte hard drive
        - An external camera 1080 pixel wide-angle lens 
        - wireless nano router 
        - External Wifi adapter
- Software Dependencies:
    - Keras
    - Tensorflow
    - Numpy
    - PIL
    - Sklearn
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Datetime
    - os

## Steps for Running the Project 
1. Install Dependencies
2. Clone Repository Here: https://github.com/EEE511-Hand-Gesture-Control/Hand-Gesture-Robot-Control
3. Connect to the robot’s network via ethernet or WiFi
4. Ensure computer has access to a camera (internal or external)
5. Run “robotControlFromImageRec.py”
6. Gesture in front of camera and verify robot output
